# AI-Planet-Scalable Language Model Inference Service

# Overview:

This project focuses on developing a scalable Language Model (LM) inference service using Ollama, which involves deployment, stress testing, and autoscaling in a Kubernetes environment. The goal is to ensure robust performance and scalability for handling varying loads of requests.

# Implementation:

1)Architecture Overview:
The system utilizes Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Ollama is employed for managing Language Model inference, providing efficient query responses.

2)Components:
Kubernetes Cluster: Manages the deployment and scaling of LM inference services.
Ollama: Core service handling LM queries.
Load Testing: Implemented using k6 to simulate varying loads and validate performance metrics.

3)Deployment:
Docker containers encapsulate the LM inference service.
Kubernetes Deployment and Service objects manage container instances and expose them internally.

# Testing Methodology:

1)Load Testing Setup:
Utilized k6 for load testing to simulate user traffic and evaluate system performance under different loads.
Scenarios configured to ramp up users, maintain load, and ramp down to validate scaling behaviors.

2)Metrics Monitored:
Request latency
Throughput (requests per second)
Error rates

3)Stress Testing:
Conducted stress tests to determine system limits and identify potential bottlenecks.

# Results:

1)Performance Metrics:
Latency: Average response time under varying loads.
Throughput: Maximum requests processed per second.
Error Rates: Frequency and types of errors encountered during testing.

2)Scalability:
Kubernetes autoscaling configurations adjusted based on load test results.
Observed scalability with increased load and efficient resource utilization.

# Best Practices and Lessons Learned:

1)Containerization: Benefits of Docker for consistency and portability across environments.
2)Kubernetes Orchestration: Effective management of containerized applications at scale.
3)Load Testing: Importance of simulating realistic workloads to validate performance and identify optimizations.

# Setup Reproduction:
To reproduce this setup and conduct tests:

1)Prerequisites:
Docker installed
Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, AKS, GKE)

2)Steps:
Clone the project repository.
Navigate to the Kubernetes deployment directory.
Apply Kubernetes YAML files to deploy services and configure autoscaling.
Install k6 for load testing and execute k6 run load_test.js from the project directory.

# Example commands:

git clone <repository-url>

cd scalable-llm-inference/kubernetes

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

k6 run load_test.js

# Conclusion:

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of implementing and testing a scalable Language Model inference service. By following the outlined steps, developers can replicate the setup, validate performance metrics, and optimize system scalability based on observed results.
